# 🌍 Procedural World Generation - Godot 2D Demo

This is a small procedural generation demo built with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).  
The goal is to explore techniques for generating infinite 2D top-down worlds in real time.

## 🧠 Features

- Procedural terrain generation using noise
- Infinite world streaming with chunk-based loading
- Optimized for performance with dynamic tilemaps
- Configurable chunk loading (render distance, memory size)

## 🗺️ Planned (maybe)

- Biomes implementation
- Resources spawning
